# topological_mixing
[Topological mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_mixing) (or topological transitivity) means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or open set of its phase space eventually overlaps with any other given region.

Six iterations of a set of states passed through the logistic map.
x → 4 x (1 – x) 
To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions, a second state, y , was created as 
y → (x + y) mod 1

it is easier to find out about mixing by comparing these itertions in one frame

As it is clear, regions are overlaping each other.
